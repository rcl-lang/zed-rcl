# zed-rcl

This repository contains the [Zed extension][zext] for the [RCL configuration
language][rcl].

This repository is based on files extracted from the main repository available
at the following remotes:

 * <https://github.com/ruuda/rcl>
 * <https://codeberg.org/ruuda/rcl>

The upstream source of truth for the extension is the `grammar/zed` directory in
the main repository, to make it easier to keep all the grammars in sync in one
place. The files have been exported here because Zed extensions need to live at
the top level of their repository.
